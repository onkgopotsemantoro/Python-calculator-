A simple calculator built in Python by Onkgopotse, using Pydroid 3 
Python Calculator

üìò Project Overview

Onkgopotse's Calculator is a beginner-friendly Python program designed to perform simple mathematical operations. It helps new programmers understand how logic, conditions, and input/output work in coding.

This project was built entirely on a mobile device using the Pydroid 3 app, proving that anyone can start learning to code with minimal tools just motivation and creativity.
The main goal of this project is to:

Learn basic Python programming concepts (functions, loops, conditionals, user input).

Build a working terminal-based program.

Demonstrate problem-solving and logical thinking skills.

Showcase an understanding of software development fundamentals for bursary and portfolio purposes.

üíª Features

‚úîÔ∏è User-friendly terminal interface
‚úîÔ∏è Four mathematical operations:
‚ÄÉ1Ô∏è‚É£ Addition
‚ÄÉ2Ô∏è‚É£ Subtraction
‚ÄÉ3Ô∏è‚É£ Multiplication
‚ÄÉ4Ô∏è‚É£ Division

‚úîÔ∏è Error handling for invalid inputs (optional to add later)
‚úîÔ∏è Can easily be extended to include advanced math features like powers or square roots
Technologies Used

Language: Python 3

Platform: Pydroid 3 (Android)

Tools: GitHub for version control and portfolio buildingHow to Run the Program

1. Open the Pydroid 3 app on your phone.


2. Create a new Python file and name it calculator.py.


3. Paste in your calculator code.


4. Run the program ‚Äî a menu will appear asking for your operation choice and numbers.


5. The calculator will display the correct result in the terminal.Through this project, I learned how to:

Use Python functions and if-else statements.

Handle user input and display output.

Write clear, readable code.

Document and upload code to GitHub for others to view.
